# Task-3_2 Stock Market Prediction And Forecasting (Beginner Level Task)


<h2>Probelm Statement</h2>

- The objective of this project is to predict the closing stock price of Tata Global Beverages Ltd. for the next 28 days using a stacked LSTM neural network.

<h2>Approach</h2>
The project involves the following approach:

- We will use a stacked LSTM neural network to predict the closing stock price for the next 28 days.
- We will preprocess the data by scaling it between 0 and 1 and splitting it into training and testing datasets.
- We will then reshape the data to be 3-dimensional in order to feed it to the stacked LSTM model.
- We will train the model on the training data and validate it on the testing data.
- Finally, we will make predictions on the future 28 days.

<h2>Dataset</h2>

<h2>Results</h2>
We will evaluate the performance of the model using mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). We will compare the predicted stock prices with the actual stock prices for the testing data. We will plot the predicted and actual stock prices on a graph to visualize the performance of the model.
