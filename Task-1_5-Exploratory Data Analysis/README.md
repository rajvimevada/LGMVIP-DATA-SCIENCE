<h2>Approach</h2>
The project involves the following approach:

- Load the dataset using Python libraries such as pandas and numpy
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing steps to remove any missing or irrelevant data
- Perform exploratory data analysis to identify trends and patterns in the data. This includes analyzing the frequency of terrorist attacks in different countries, regions, and over time.
- Visualize the results using charts and graphs to gain insights and draw conclusions.
