# Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm

<h2>Probelm Statement</h2>
Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.


<h2>Approach</h2>
The project involves the following approach:

- Loading the dataset using pandas
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
- Creating a Decision Tree classifier using scikit-learn
- Training the classifier using the training set
- Visualizing the classifier using graphviz and matplotlib
- Predicting the class for new data fed to the classifier

<h2>Results</h2>
The Decision Tree classifier created in this project can accurately predict the class of new data fed to it. The accuracy of the classifier can be evaluated using various metrics like confusion matrix, classification report, etc.
