<h1>Task-1_5-Exploratory Data Analysis (Intermediate Level Task)</h1>


<h2> Problem Statement</h2> 

- Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Global Terrorism’
- As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism.


<h2>Approach</h2>
The project involves the following approach:

- Load the dataset using Python libraries such as pandas and numpy
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing steps to remove any missing or irrelevant data
- Perform exploratory data analysis to identify trends and patterns in the data. This includes analyzing the frequency of terrorist attacks in different countries, regions, and over time.
- Visualize the results using charts and graphs to gain insights and draw conclusions.
- Use the findings to identify the hot zones of terrorism.

<h2>Results</h2>
The analysis of the dataset reveals that the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa are the hot zones of terrorism. Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan are the countries that are most affected by terrorist attacks. The analysis also shows that the frequency of terrorist attacks has increased significantly over the past few decades.

<h1>Task-2_6-Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm (Intermediate Level Task)</h1>


<h2>Probelm Statement</h2>

- Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. 
- The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.


<h2>Approach</h2>
The project involves the following approach:

- Loading the dataset using pandas
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
- Creating a Decision Tree classifier using scikit-learn
- Training the classifier using the training set
- Visualizing the classifier using graphviz and matplotlib
- Predicting the class for new data fed to the classifier

<h2>Dataset</h2>

<h2>Results</h2>
The Decision Tree classifier created in this project can accurately predict the class of new data fed to it. The accuracy of the classifier can be evaluated using various metrics like confusion matrix, classification report, etc.
